    Participation Pattern: 
    One aspect of an event is given by the objects participating in an event such as persons. The participation pattern of the event model F enables to express this constitutive aspect of events formally. As shown in Figure 2, participation is expressed by an EventParticipationSituation that satisfies an EventParticipationDescription. The situation includes the Event being described and the objects being participants of this event. The EventParticipationDescription classiﬁes the described event and its participants by the concepts DescribedEvent and Participant.
    
    The concept DescribedEvent classifies the Event described by an instance of the pattern, e.g., the event of a ﬂooded cellar. As is presented in DOLCE’s DnS pattern, classiﬁers such as “Flooding” or “Hurricane” are represented as instances of the class Concept. Thus they occur at the same modeling level like concrete events such as the Hurricane Katrina. Only in this way, the instantiation relationship between “Katrina” and “Hurricane” can be reiﬁed and thus be talked about in a ﬁrst-order theory. Likewise, instances of Participant classify objects as participants of the event, e.g., the ﬁreman reporting about the event of a ﬂooded cellar, the landlord of the aﬀected building, and the aﬀected building itself. Instances of Participant can be deﬁned in a domain ontology as indicated by Figure 2. For instance, some domain ontology modeling emergency terminology may deﬁne the role of a person being aﬀected by some emergency case, i.e., the emergency subject, and the role describing the rescue staﬀ such as ﬁremen. As indicated by Figure 2, the described event, participating objects, and their roles can be deﬁned in some domain ontology so that the participation pattern can be applied to express participation with respect to arbitrary application domains, e.g., emergency response.
