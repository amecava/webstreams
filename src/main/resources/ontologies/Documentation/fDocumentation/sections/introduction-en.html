    The explicit modeling of events and event-based systems are increasingly
    gaining widespread attention by research and industry [24] due to a couple
    of reasons. Firstly, we ﬁnd an increasing number of systems that are
    treating events, e.g., media delivery, recognition of vandalism, or
    management of emergency incidents. Secondly, a fastly growing number of
    intelligence-collecting devices such sensors, CCTV, upload facilities, and
    others lead to an ubiquity of events being recognized and communicated.
    Thirdly, event detection, clustering, and annotation is and will be realized
    in many diﬀerent software components and proprietary solutions using a large
    variety of internal data models. Thus, multiple systems are connected for
    managing events resulting in a complex, so-called distributed event-based
    system. Such a distributed eventbased system is a software system consisting
    of several components that are characterized by taking events as input and
    providing events as output. However, in contrast to related work in the ﬁeld
    of publish/subscribe systems that work at a technical level of event
    management, the distributed event-based systems considered here deal with
    events on the level of the domain under consideration. These domain events
    may be very complex and may be linked to a variety of aspects such as time
    and space, objects and persons involved, as well as structural relationships
    like mereological, causal, and correlate relationships. Thus, the semantic
    interpretation of ad-hoc, ideosyncratic event models may easily become
    ambiguous rendering the communication between and integration of the
    diﬀerent event-based components (and possibly diﬀerent event-based systems)
    a challenging task. Consequently, a common model for domain events and their
    various aspects is needed. However, today’s event models such as are
    developed ad-hoc and lack formal semantics. This hinders interoperability of
    the diﬀerent event-based components and event-based systems aggravating the
    treatment of events in already complex, distributed infrastructures. What is
    needed is a formal representation of events in a model that allows easy
    interchange of event information between diﬀerent event-based components and
    systems. Such an event model is presented in this paper. For our event
    model, F, we have analyzed existing event models and event-based systems and
    we have conducted a study of relevant work in foundational sciences such as
    philosophy and linguistics. As a result, we have decided to base the event
    model F on the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering
    (DOLCE) and to follow DOLCE’s pattern-oriented approach for ontology
    development. The DOLCE approach provides native support for modularization
    of F and extension by domain speciﬁc ontologies. The event model F provides
    support for all aspects of events, namely time and space, objects and
    persons involved, mereological relationships of events through sub-events,
    causal relationships, and documentation by sensor data such as media
    content.</span
