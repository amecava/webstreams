    Events are central elements in the representation of data from domains such
    as history, 1 cultural heritage [3,6], multimedia [12] and geography [14].
    Event-centered modeling captures the dynamic aspects of a domain. In
    addition, events provide a natural way to explicate complicated relations
    between people, places, actions and objects. In this paper we investigate
    the representation of events on the Web. We propose an event model called
    the Simple Event Model (SEM), which is designed with a minimum of semantic
    commitment to achieve interoperability with data sets from various domains.
    The diversity and openness of the Web poses challenges on the design of an
    event model. We show how we minimally commit our model by assuming nothing
    about the used vocabularies or the structure of the data. We draw further
    requirements from two domains: historic events and events in the maritime
    safety and security domain. Although very different, these domains do have
    commonalities: from both it becomes apparent that the model needs to
    represent not only the description of who did what, when and where, but also
    the roles that each actor played, the time during which a role is valid and
    the authority according to whom this role is assigned. Several event models
    or ontologies have been published over the past years [3–8,12]. They differ
    in their focus (class or property centered), domain speciﬁcity, size and
    level of formalization. We review and compare the design choices of existing
    models to explicate what SEM contributes to the existing literature. In
    addition, we show how we create mappings from our model to existing event
    models. Learning to properly use an event model is hard and populating it
    with instances is a time consuming and error prone task. Therefore, we
    designed a Prolog API for SEM. It facilitates the creation of SEM instances
    by hiding some details of the model to a user and it is integrated with the
    SWI-Prolog space [10] and semweb packages [13]. The combination of these
    three provides a fast and efﬁcient indexing for geopositions as well as RDF
    and literals (strings, numbers, dates, etc.), along with spatial, RDFS, OWL,
    and rule reasoning. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
    present the general requirements that underly SEM’s design and how events
    are modeled in SEM in Section 2. We provide a short overview of event models
    in Section 5; we review in particular three models as representative
    examples and compare them to SEM. The API and its coupling with the other
    Prolog packages is demonstrated in Section 3, on examples from the maritime
    domain. We conclude with a discussion and future work in Section 6. The RDF
    code of SEM can be found online.</span
