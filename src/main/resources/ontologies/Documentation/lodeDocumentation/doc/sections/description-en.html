    The CIDOC CRM and ABC ontologies aim at enabling better interoperability among metadata standards for describing complex multimedia objects held by museums and libraries. The events they intend to describe include both historical events in the broad sense (e.g. wars, or births) as well as events in the histories of the objects being described (e.g. changes of ownership, or restoration).

    The Event Ontology (EO) was developed by the Centre for Digital Music to be used in conjunction with music-related ontologies. Although intended to describe events such as performances, compositions, recordings, or sound generation, there is nothing speciﬁc to the music domain in this event ontology. EO is the most used event ontology in the Linked Data community. EventsML-G2 has been developed by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) for exchanging structured information about events among news providers and their partners. It is intended to represent both planned events and past or breaking events as reported in the news, thus adopting a journalistic point of view.
    
    DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL) is a lightweight “upper” ontology for grounding domain-speciﬁc ontologies in a set of well-analyzed basic concepts. It is a combination and simpliﬁcation of the DOLCE foundational ontology and the Constructive Descriptions and Situations pattern for representing aspects of social reality. The F Event Model is a formal model of events built on top of DUL. It provides additional properties and classes for modeling participation in events, as well as parthood relations, causal relations, and correlations between events. F also provides the ability to assert that multiple models represent views upon or interpretations of the same event. OpenCYC is also an “upper” ontology, but at the other end of the spectrum from DUL: rather than being a lightweight set of core concepts it provides hundreds of thousands of concepts intended to model “all of human consensus reality”.
