  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <span class="markdown">
    People conventionally refer to an action or occurrence taking place at a
    certain time at a speciﬁc location as an event. This notion is potentially
    useful for connecting individual facts recorded in the rapidly growing
    collection of linked data sets and for discovering more complex
    relationships between data. In this paper, we provide an overview and
    comparison of existing RDFS+OWL event models, looking at the diﬀerent
    choices they make of how to represent events. We describe a recommended
    model for publishing records of events as Linked Data. We present tools for
    populating this model and a prototype of an “event directory” web service,
    which can be used to locate stable URIs for events that have occurred and to
    provide RDFS+OWL descriptions of them and links to related resources.</span
