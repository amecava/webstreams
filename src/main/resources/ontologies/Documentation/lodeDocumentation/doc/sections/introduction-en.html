    Though their speciﬁc methods diﬀer signiﬁcantly, both historians and
    journalists work to produce narrative chains of events to explain phenomena
    in the past. The resulting historical records of events constitute valuable
    cultural heritage of interest to academics as well as the general public.
    The Linked Data 1 eﬀort seeks to publish and connect RDF data sets on the
    Web using dereferenceable URIs for identifying web documents, real-world
    objects, links between them and/or other pieces of information. Yet, while
    standard and widely used vocabularies have emerged for representing people,
    places, and other types of entities as Linked Data, none has yet emerged
    speciﬁcally for events. The term “event” has several meanings. It is used to
    mean both phenomena that have happened (e.g. things reported in news
    articles or explained by historians) and phenomena that are scheduled to
    happen (e.g. things put in calendars and datebooks). Various standards and
    formats have been proposed for representing the latter as structured data,
    usually for personal information management purposes 2 . Furthermore, there
    are several web services available for aggregating, classifying and
    syndicating scheduled events 3 . In this paper, we focus on the former
    category: phenomena that have happened in the past. Hence, we assume events
    to be unique entities that, while they may have been part of a series of
    similar events, occurred only once. This paper makes two contributions.
    First, we compare existing models of historical events looking at the
    diﬀerent choices they make of how to represent events (Section 2). These
    models serve diﬀerent communities and have diﬀerent strengths. Our goal is
    not to propose yet another ontology per se, but rather to build an
    interlingua model that solves an interoperability problem by providing a set
    of axioms expressing mappings between existing event ontologies (Section 3).
    Second, we present tools for populating this model with data coming from
    existing sources, such as Wikipedia timelines. We describe a prototype of an
    “event directory” 4 web service which can be used to locate stable URIs for
    past events and to provide RDFS+OWL descriptions of those events and links
    to related resources.</span
